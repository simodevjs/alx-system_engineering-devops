**/My First Postmortem**/

**/Issue Summary/**

• Duration of the Outage: The outage lasted for 2 hours, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM GMT on May 10, 2024.
• Impact: A critical service outage affected our primary web application, resulting in a complete inability for users to access the platform. Approximately 70% of our users experienced either slow response times or time-outs during the incident.
• Root Cause: The root cause was identified as a configuration error in the load balancer, which led to improper request routing.

**/Timeline/**

• 3:00 PM: Issue detected by automated monitoring tools which triggered alerts due to high response time and error rates.
• 3:05 PM: Initial investigation by the Site Reliability Engineering team assumed a spike in traffic, but server metrics did not corroborate this.
• 3:30 PM: Further investigation revealed unusual server behavior; focus shifted to server configuration and networking.
• 3:45 PM: Misdirection occurred due to initial assumption; wasted time in scaling up the servers without checking load balancer configurations.
• 4:15 PM: Incident escalated to the network operations team.
• 4:50 PM: Root cause identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer.
• 5:00 PM: Configuration error corrected, service gradually restored to full functionality.

**/Root Cause and Resolution/**

**/Detailed Cause:/** During a routine update, the load balancer configuration was incorrectly updated, causing it to route traffic unevenly across the available servers.
**/Detailed Resolution:/** The correct configuration was restored, and the load balancer was restarted, which resolved the outage.

**/Corrective and Preventative Measures/**
**/Improvements/Fixes:/** Improve our change management procedures for critical configurations. Introduce additional automated checks for configuration sanity before deployment.

**/Tasks:/**

Review and update the change management protocol by May 20, 2024.
Implement a new CI pipeline stage that automatically tests load balancer configurations in a staging environment by June 1, 2024.
Conduct a workshop on best practices for change management and incident response for the engineering team by June 15, 2024.
