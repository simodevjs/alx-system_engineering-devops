**/My First Postmortem: The Day We Played Hide and Seek with Our Server Traffic/**

**/Engaging Introduction:/**

Imagine it's a calm Friday afternoon; you're ready to wind down the week, and suddenly, the digital world you've created decides to spice things up. On May 10, 2024, our primary web application decided to play a game of hide and seek with server traffic, leading to a baffling, albeit enlightening, two-hour chase.

**/Issue Summary:/**

Duration of the Outage: A not-so-fun 2 hours from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM GMT.
Impact: Picture this—70% of our users were at a virtual standstill, unable to access services, with their patience thinning faster than our server's traffic handling. It was like throwing a large party but forgetting to unlock the front door.
Root Cause: An enthusiastic yet misguided update to our load balancer configuration led to this unexpected game of digital hide and seek.

**/Timeline:/**

3:00 PM: Alert sirens from our monitoring tools—our first clue that something was amiss.

3:05 PM: The initial theory? A traffic spike. But alas, our servers were as calm as a cucumber—no spike in sight.

3:30 PM: A deeper dive revealed servers behaving more like they were on a coffee break.

3:45 PM: A wild goose chase into scaling servers, which, as it turned out, was as useful as a chocolate teapot.

4:15 PM: We called in the cavalry—our network operations team.

4:50 PM: Eureka! The misconfigured load balancer was the party pooper.

5:00 PM: Configuration restored, traffic flowing, crisis averted.

**/Root Cause and Resolution:/**

Detailed Cause: In the excitement of a routine update, someone played a little too fast and loose with the load balancer settings.

Detailed Resolution: A quick rollback to the previous configuration and a system restart brought back harmony and order.

**/Corrective and Preventive Measures:/**

Improvements: Tighten up those change management protocols and ensure configurations are double-checked before they go live.

Tasks:

Update the change management procedures by end of May.

Roll out a new configuration validation step in the deployment pipeline by mid-June.

Hold a debrief session, complete with donuts, to discuss the lessons learned by late June.

**/Closing Thought:/**

Every outage is a mystery novel in disguise. This incident taught us the value of vigilance, thoroughness, and maybe a bit of humility. Remember, in the digital world, every minute counts, and so does every configuration setting!
